# What's New

This release upgrades the Linux rendering backend of Crown to a
full **Vulkan** solution. That gives us a clean path for future performance
work and fixes compatibility issues with tricky but increasingly common
setups like **XWayland + NVIDIA** where the old GL backend wasn't doing
well.

In this update we added **15 new manual pages**, covering [how](https://docs.crownengine.org/html/latest/importing_resources/index.html) to [import](https://docs.crownengine.org/html/latest/importing_resources/importing_sprites.html)
[resources](https://docs.crownengine.org/html/latest/importing_resources/importing_textures.html), many [Level](https://docs.crownengine.org/html/latest/level_editor/level_viewport.html) [Editor](https://docs.crownengine.org/html/latest/level_editor/inspector.html) [features](https://docs.crownengine.org/html/latest/level_editor/level_tree.html), and [various](https://docs.crownengine.org/html/latest/rendering/lighting.html) [other](https://docs.crownengine.org/html/latest/physics/rigid_bodies.html) [topics](https://docs.crownengine.org/html/latest/level_editor/texture_settings.html) to help you get up to speed faster.

Crown 0.61 also brings a much-needed **HSV color picker**, a new **flythrough
camera mode** for zipping around viewports, and lots of small **tweaks and fixes**
across the editor.
